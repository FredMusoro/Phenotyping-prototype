# Phenotyping-prototype
Greenhouses phenotyping prototype - Machine vision systems for monitoring phenotyping variables in greenhouses.

Within the framework of the new technology development for phenotyping, we have developed an innovative prototype for the quick and efficient checking of plants in greenhouse environments. This system is cost-effective, upgradeable and modular. This first version of the system, has a mobile frame that can be moved on the greenhouse benches and at the same time it has a checking camera system per plant, which positions a color-depth camera on the plant to be checked.  Both systems require a laptop and a control code to be operated.

In this first instance we are developing the movement control of a step motor, which moves the camera on a rail and in turn we are controlling the acquisition of both color and depth images. The milestone of development for this first phase is to have a moderately autonomous system that requires minimal human intervention. As an expected product of this system, we expect to have a stable control application and a correct database to perform the biomass measurement and plant detection algorithms.
